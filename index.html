<p><strong>360° Photos and Video Tours:</strong> The service includes 360-degree images and short video tours for items like furniture or appliances, giving buyers a detailed look from home.</p>

<h3>Item Assessment and Pricing Guidance</h3>

<p><strong>Category Expertise:</strong> Specialized knowledge in categories like electronics, antiques, fashion, and more to accurately assess each item’s worth.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> Automated price adjustments can be applied based on buyer interest and time listed, maximizing the chance of sale without constant price management from the seller.</p>

<h3>Easy Listing Creation and Management</h3>
<p><strong>Automated Listings:</strong> After the in-home session, the service generates and uploads listings on the website, including all photos and descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Customizable Listing Options:</strong> Sellers can edit or approve listings directly through the website or app if they want control over certain details like descriptions or keywords.</p>
